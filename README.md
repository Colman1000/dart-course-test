# DART COURSE TEST

Welcome, This is a course completion test for [Dart](https://dart.dev), aimed at accessing you.

You have to attempt all `15 challenges` in this test.

There are 2 folders; `lib` and `test` folder. 

In the `lib` folder, there are 20 folders, `q1`, `q2`, `q3` ... `q15`. The `qx` folders contain the
challenges while the `test` folder contains the Dart Test Suites that would check your code.

In each `q` folder, there are 2 files: a `README.md` file and an `index.dart` file. The `README.md` file contains the
instructions for the challenge and the `index.dart` file is where you would write your code.

For each challenge, there is an accompanying `Dart Test Suite` to help test the correctness of your solution.

At any point, you can run the `test suite` for any challenge you are working on by running `dart test test/{name_of_challenge}.dart` in your terminal. For example; say you are working on the challenge in the `q1 folder`, you can at anytime, run the test suite for `q1` by running:

```bash
dart test test/q1.dart
```

#### NOTES

* Try to answer as many questions as you can.
* Take your time to carefully read the instructions for each challenge.


### Good luck ðŸ¥³.
